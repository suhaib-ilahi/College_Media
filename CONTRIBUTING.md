## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/College_Media.git
   cd College_Media
   ```
3. **Set up upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ewocs/College_Media.git
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install

   # Return to root
   cd ..
   ```
5. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   # Edit backend/.env with your configuration
   ```
6. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2: Start frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Choose an issue** from the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Ewocs/College_Media/issues) or create one
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Commit your changes** with descriptive messages
6. **Push your branch** and create a pull request
7. **Address review feedback** and make necessary changes
8. **Merge** once approved

## Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive, lowercase branch names with hyphens. Follow this pattern:

```
<type>/<description>
```

### Branch Types

- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes for production
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks, dependencies, etc.

### Examples

```
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-validation
docs/api-documentation
refactor/user-service
test/auth-middleware
chore/update-dependencies
```

## Commit Message Conventions

Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed and why. Follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Commit Types

- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

### Scope (Optional)

Specify the part of the codebase affected:
- `frontend`, `backend`
- Component or file names
- `auth`, `posts`, `chatbot`

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh functionality

fix(frontend): resolve login form validation error

docs: update API documentation for posts endpoint

refactor(backend): simplify user authentication middleware

test: add unit tests for post service

chore: update Node.js dependencies
```

### Guidelines

- Use present tense ("add" not "added")
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters
- Use the body for detailed explanations if needed
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `fix: resolve login issue #123`

## Pull Request Process

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

3. **Create a PR** on GitHub:
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Link related issues
   - Add screenshots for UI changes
